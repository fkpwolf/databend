  Databend Query Metrics
---

A `databend-query` server records metrics in table [system.metrics](../../13-sql-reference/20-system-tables/system-metrics.md).

The [metric_api_address](../07-query/10-query-config.md) to listen on that can be scraped by Prometheus and will return a [prometheus](http://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/) format of metrics.

> Note: Default metric_api_address value is : 127.0.0.1:7070 , Prometheus can access this uri: http://127.0.0.1:7070/metrics

```sql
MySQL> DESC system.metrics;
+--------+---------+------+---------+-------+
| Field  | Type    | Null | Default | Extra |
+--------+---------+------+---------+-------+
| metric | VARCHAR | NO   |         |       |
| kind   | VARCHAR | NO   |         |       |
| labels | VARCHAR | NO   |         |       |
| value  | VARCHAR | NO   |         |       |

```

Metrics has four attributes: `metric`, `kind`, `labels`, `value`.

`metric` indicate the name of the metric contained in the databend-query.

`kind` records the kind of metric.
Available kinds:
* [`counter`](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#counter)
* [`gauge`](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#gauge)
* [`summary`](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#summary)
* `untyped` is part of `summary`

`labels` records the label of metric.

`value` records the value of metric.

## Metrics

:::info

Databend uses `summary` metrics to keep track of the total time spent handling various requests.
Value quantile contains: [0.0, 0.5, 0.9, 0.99, 0.999].
