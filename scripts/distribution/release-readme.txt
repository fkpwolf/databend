Thank you for downloading Databend, an open-source elastic and workload-aware modern cloud data warehouse.

Get started with a standalone Databend:
1. Edit the configuration files in 'configs' to customize Databend settings.
2. Start Databend: ./scripts/start.sh
3. Run queries with MySQL client or ClickHouse / Databend HTTP handler.
4. Stop Databend: ./scripts/stop.sh

NOTE: If you deploy Databend with a self-hosted S3-compatible object storage,
set the environment variable STORAGE_S3_ENABLE_VIRTUAL_HOST_STYLE to 'true' before starting Databend.
