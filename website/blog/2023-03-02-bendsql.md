Recently, the Databend team made the CLI tool "bendsql" available to Databend users. The tool was rolled out last year and provided a command-line alternative to connect to [Databend Cloud](https://www.databend.com/). Now, the team has extended its capabilities by allowing connections to Databend. This post walks you through the installation process and basic commands of bendsql.
